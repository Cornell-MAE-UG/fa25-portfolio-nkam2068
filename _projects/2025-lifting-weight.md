Problem: Design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.

Constraints:
- Design must be contained in a 2D space of 150cm long and 50cm tall.
- Design must involve at most 3 pin supports, two of which must be mounted on the ground
- Design must include a linear actuator
- Assume all supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

Static Analysis:
See image for FBD of mechanism along with use of equilibrium equations to determine maximum weight (220.5 kN) lifted to a height of 50 cm.
