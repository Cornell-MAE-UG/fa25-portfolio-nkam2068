Part 2:
Problem: The bar in your mechanism is no longer rigid. In fact, it is now best described as
a beam which bends due to the combined action of the weight and the actuator force.
Consider only the components of these forces transverse to your beam.

Assuming that the beam is fixed-free and with the constraint that the beam deflection is less than or equal to 2% of the length, the maximum deflection is -31.6 mm for a beam made of Magnesium Alloy that has a circular cross section with a diameter of 182 mm (see image for analysis and work, as well as drawn beam design).
